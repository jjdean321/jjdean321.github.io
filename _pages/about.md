# 💬 Biography
I am a Ph.D. student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), advised by Prof. Xunying Liu. I am fortunate to work with Prof. Xurong Xie and other collaborators in Andrew's group. My research currently focuses on exploring the idea of building an efficient, universal, and high-performance speech recognition system.
