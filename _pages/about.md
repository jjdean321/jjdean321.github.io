# üí¨ Biography
Hi, there! I received my Ph.D. from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) under the supervision of <a href='https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~xyliu/'>Prof. Xunying Liu</a>. I also worked closely with <a href='https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~xrxie?language=en'>Prof. Xurong Xie</a>. My research interests focus on speech language modeling, speech generation, automatic speech recognition, and music information retrieval.
